## LeetCode Exercises Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode exercises repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems.

### Problem List
Here's a list of the problems I've solved so far:

- [1. Two Sum](./1_TwoSum/)
- [2. Add Two Numbers](./2_Add%20Two%20Numbers/)
- [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](./3_LogestSubstring/)
- [9. Palindrome Number](./9_Palindrome%20Number/)
- [344. Reverse String](./344_Reverse%20String/)
- [704. Binary Search](./704_Binary%20Search/)
- [1456. Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length](./1456_Maximum%20Number%20of%20Vowels/)

### File Structure
Each problem is contained in its own directory, named after the problem's number and title (with spaces replaced by underscores). Inside each directory, you'll find my solution to the problem in one or more files, along with a README file (if necessary) that explains the problem and my approach to solving it.

Here's an example file structure for problem 1, "Two Sum":

```
1_TwoSum/
├── 1_TwoSum.cpp
├── 1_TwoSum.ipynb
└── README.md
```

In this example, I've provided two solutions to the problem: one in C++ (in the file `1_TwoSum.cpp`) and one in Jupyter Notebook (in the file `1_TwoSum.ipynb`).

### Contributing
Feel free to contribute to this repository by submitting your own solutions to the problems or by suggesting improvements to the existing solutions. To contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b my-new-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push your changes to your fork (`git push origin my-new-branch`).
5. Create a new pull request and describe your changes.

Please make sure your code follows the same file structure and naming conventions as the existing solutions.

#### Ownership
Adding ownership comments to your scripts is a great way to give credit to yourself or others who have contributed to the code. Here's an example ownership comment that you can add to each script in your LeetCode exercises repository:

```cpp

Creation Date: 5/5/2023

Description: 
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Solution to: 2. Add Two Numbers

```

Here's what each line means:

- `Author`: Your name or username, or the name of the original author if someone else wrote the code.
- `Creation Date`: The date when the script was first created, in a format like "YYYY-MM-DD" or "MM/DD/YYYY".
- `Description`: A brief description of the script and its purpose, such as "Solution to LeetCode Problem X".
- `Solution to`: The LeetCode problem number and title, like "Problem 1: Two Sum".
- `URL`: The URL to the LeetCode problem description, which can be useful for future reference.
